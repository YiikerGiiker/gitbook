Keep it simple & stupid - Take frequent breaks - Eat
- Be in the present. STEP by STEP.
- Look for easy solutions first
- Parts of an exploit may fail ([[Scrutiny]])
- Check the home directory carefully (file named`.~` [[Scrutiny]])
- Follow the storyline
- If something looks suspicious, dig into it first.
- In google searches, start with a broad scope before narrowing it down
- Also in google searches, some links might contain more than what appears
- Look for the first google results, don’t over-anticipate the complexity
- Read articles in full, the solution often appears after a good read
- Assume an exploit for version X.Y applies to all prior versions
- Fuzz with the biggest wordlists
- Reuse credentials on all services
- Reuse passwords on other users
- Use username as password
- Play with credentials and case sensitivity (remember Jack)
- Try default credentials
- Consider the machine name as credentials
- Scan for UDP ports
- When stuck, refer to the course (keep an open mind, remember SNMP)
- Check for bash or powershell history
- Connect with the mediums of the storyline (remember SSH vs Evil-WinRM)
- Try! Even if the data you gathered doesn’t guarantee a 100% success rate
- When you don’t know a port, probe with netcat and telnet
- Bruteforce is rare, keep it for later
- Stop thinking like HTB, it’s never gonna be such weird & complex stuff
- Always try evil-winrm anyways (Remember first oscp)
- Check for .git in Web and remember git is made of commits
- Google applications for exploits even if they look custom
- Look for Changelog, changelog or CHANGELOG on sites
- On linux look for CRONs
- Check for robots.txt on sites
- If you find a .exe on a share or at a weird spot try to replace it by a rev shell
- REVERT
    - When an exploit doesn’t work and it should
    - When you should catch a rev shell and you don’t
    - After a while not finding anything (no creds no vuln…)
- Always look for the different features of an exploit
- If an exploit doesn’t work try another one
- Identify CVEs before you find their related exploits
- If two or more CVEs follow each other, try them all
    - EG CVE-2020-11651 and CVE-2020-11652
- Try default credentials found in exploits (see PG Practice `Crane`)
- In web check for `robots.txt` `sitemap.xml` `.svn` `.DS_STORE`
- Use the first result of google
- Use accounts may require a $ at the end (svc_apache --> svc_apache$)
